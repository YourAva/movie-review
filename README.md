# React Movies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Info

### About
This is my very first solo react project! I've been taking some courses on udemy to learn react and this is what I've managed to pull together with my current progress. I hope to build ontop of this project as my skill develops.

### Project Overview
This project does some cool stuff. Firstly,  It displays various pieces of information about different movies, along with a preview of the DVD. The Movie item is entirely customisable, being able to insert different pieces of data into it. This could most likely be hooked up with an API which may be a project for the future. 

If you want to build the project, run ```npm run start```, it will host it on [port 3000](http://localhost:3000) <3

### Future plans
As said, I plan to build on this project. I plan to do a few things with it...

- [ ] Make a generally nice and easy to use UI
- [ ] Ticket buy system (maybe a cart?)
- [ ] Sign in / Login system

*Most likely, this project won't grow too far. It's more of a thing to do in my free time, but I hope that one day my skills will be good enough to do some of the above. :P*
